# Assignments

I have created a scaffolded system of assignments to help you build your knowledge from the ground up.  There are three stages of assessment due on Fridays, Tuesdays and Sundays.

**Guiding Question Sets**
The GQS's are meant to gauge your comprehension of the content following reading of the ebook and watching associated videos.  They will assess your recall of definitions and concepts.  These are due on Fridays, so you should plan to have completed the reading and videos for the week by then.  There is no time limit and you you may attempt these up to two times.  Feel free to use your notes!


**Homework**
Homework is the second level of assessment.  Weekly HW sets are due on Tuesdays and will cover the previous week's content.  They are open-ended questions that will be submitted as a photo or scan to the appropriate assignment in Canvas. Details on HW expectations and grading can be found here. If you have questions about HW problems, I encourage you to reach out to me (or any of the teaching staff) or post your question to Piazza!  


**Knowledge Checks**
The final check is a Knowledge Check.  These will be due on Sundays.  These are optional, but I do offer an incentive to complete these (as explained in the "Borderline Grade" policy in the syllabus).


**Exams**
