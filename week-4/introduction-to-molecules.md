# Introduction to Compounds


We know all about the structure of atoms and how electrons are arranged.  Now, we will begin looking at how we can rearrange electrons to form chemical bonds.  Chemical bonds hold atoms together forming compounds.  

If you would like a refresher on how atoms differ from compounds, please see the video on "[Atoms vs. Molecules](https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/chem110/lesson-1/lesson-11/ions-and-molecules/molecules.md)."

In this unit we will expand on the concept of bonding and learn about some finer details of molecular structure.  Like atoms, molecules can be counted by mass.  The molar mass (or molecular weight) of a compound can be calculated by added the molar mass of each individual atom present.

For example, the molar mass of the antibacterial chemical triclosan has a molecular formula of C
