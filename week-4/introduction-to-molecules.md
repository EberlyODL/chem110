# Introduction to Compounds


We know all about the structure of atoms and how electrons are arranged.  Now, we will begin looking at how we can rearrange electrons to form chemical bonds.  Chemical bonds hold atoms together forming compounds.  

If you would like a refresher on how atoms differ from compounds, please see the video on "[Atoms vs. Molecules](https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/chem110/lesson-1/lesson-11/ions-and-molecules/molecules.md)."

In this unit we will expand on the concept of bonding and learn about some finer details of molecular structure.  Like atoms, molecules can be counted by mass.  The molar mass (or molecular weight) of a compound is the mass of 1 mole of a substance.  It can be calculated by added the molar mass of each individual atom present.

Let's use aspirin as an example.  The common analgesic has a molecular formula of $$C_9H_8O_4$$.  The molecular formula tells you exactly how many and what type of atoms are present in a molecule.  To calculate the molar mass, we would carry out the following calculation:
> $$\text{molar mass} = (9\text{ mol C atoms})(12.011\text{ g/mol C})+(8 \text{ mol H atoms})(1.008 \text{ g/mol H})+(4 \text{ mol O atoms})(15.999 \text{ g/mol O})$$ 
> $$\text{molar mass} = 180.157 \text{ g/mol}$$
