# Percent Composition

The percent composition describes the mass percentage of each element in a compound.  First, the mass percentage of an element will equal the ratio of the mass of an element in a sample to the total mass of the sample as the equation shows below. 

As an example, if a 100.0 gram sample of aspirin contains 60.0 grams of carbon, we can use this equation to calculate the mass percentage (or percent composition) of carbon in aspirin: 

$$\text{% Carbon} = \frac{60.0 \text { g carbon}}{100 \text{ g aspirin}} = 60.0% $$ 


The second equation describes the mass percentage of an element in a compound as equaling the number of atoms of that element in the compound, times the atomic weight of the element, divided by the molecular weight of the compound. If I wanted to calculate the mass percentage of oxygen in ribose, I could do so as follows (see molecular weight from slide 2):

% Oxygen = 100% * (5 O atoms)*(15.999 g/mol)/(150.13 g/mol) = 53.284% oxygen in ribose

Finally, all of the mass percentages in a compound must total 100%. Therefore, I can calculate the mass percentage of hydrogen in ribose now that I know the mass percentages of carbon and oxygen: 

% Hydrogen = 100% - 40.0% - 53.284% = 6.7% hydrogen in ribose

Alternatively we could have solved for the mass percentage of hydrogen using the same equation that we used for oxygen. We would have gotten the same answer.
