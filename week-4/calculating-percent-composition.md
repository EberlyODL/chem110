# Percent Composition

The percent composition describes the mass percentage of each element in a compound.  First, the mass percentage of an element will equal the ratio of the mass of an element in a sample to the total mass of the sample as equation 1 shows below. 

> 1) $$\text{mass % element} = \frac{\text{mass of element in sample}}{\text{ total mass of sample}}\times 100 \text%$$

As an example, if a 100.0 gram sample of aspirin contains 60.0 grams of carbon, we can use this equation to calculate the mass percentage (or percent composition) of carbon in aspirin: 


$$\text{% Carbon} = \frac{60.0 \text { g carbon}}{100 \text{ g aspirin}}\times 100 \text% = 60.0 \text{% carbon in aspirin}$$ 


Equation 2 describes the mass percentage of an element in a compound as equaling the number of atoms of that element in the compound, times the atomic weight of the element, divided by the molecular weight of the compound. 

> 2) $$\text{mass %} = \frac{(\text{# atoms of an element}) ( \text{molecular weight of element})}{\text{molecular weight of compound}}\times 100\text{%}$$



If I wanted to calculate the mass percentage of oxygen in aspirin, I could do so as follows:

$$\text{% Oxygen} = \frac{4 \text{ O atoms} \times 15.999 \text{ g/mol}}{180.157 \text{ g/mol}}\times 100\text{%} = 35.522\text{% oxygen in aspirin}$$

Finally, all of the mass percentages in a compound must total 100%. Therefore, I can calculate the mass percentage of hydrogen in aspirin now that I know the mass percentages of carbon and oxygen: 

$$\text{% Hydrogen} = 100\text{%} - 60.0\text{%} - 35.522\text{%}= 4.5\text{% hydrogen in aspirin}$$

Alternatively we could have solved for the mass percentage of hydrogen using the same equation that we used for oxygen. We would have gotten the same answer.
