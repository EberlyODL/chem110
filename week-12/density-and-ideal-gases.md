# Density and the Ideal Gas Law


**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_


* Connect between density and molar mass of a gas at a given T and P.

Using the density formula ($$d = \frac mv$$) and the ideal gas law ($$PV = nRT$$), one can derive the relationship between density and molar mass of a gas.  This is useful in determining the identity of an unknown gas.
