# Partial Pressure


**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able to…_

* Define the partial pressure of the components of a gas mixture and determine the total pressure of the mixture.

* Define the mole fraction of the components in a gas mixture, and relate mole fraction of a gas to its partial pressure.

* Use ppm to describe the mole fraction of a gas.


In this lesson, we will examine the behaviors of mixtures of gases. Generally speaking, each gas in a mixture behaves independently of the other gases in the mixture. We can describe each gas in a mixture in terms of its partial pressure. The partial pressure of a gas is the pressure that this gas would exert if it were the only gas in the container. For example, in the gas mixture illustrated in the diagram, the partial pressure of the gas represented with green dots would be the pressure in the container if all of the purple dots were removed. Similarly, the partial pressure of gas represented with purple dots would be the pressure in the container if all of the green dots were removed. One way to think about this is that the green gas doesn’t affect how evenly the purple gas is distributed in the box.

The partial pressures of all of the gases in a mixture add up to the total pressure in the container. This relationship is known as Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures. 

We can also describe the gases in a mixture in terms of their mole fraction ($$X_i$$, where “i” is the identity of a specific gas in the mixture). The mole fraction for a gas in a mixture is the number of moles of that particular gas ($$n_i$$) divided by the total number of moles present ($$n_{tot}$$) (i.e., $$X_i=n_i/n_{tot}$$). If we look at the diagram again, the mole fraction of the gas represented by the green dots would be equal to the total number of green atoms divided by the total number of atoms (green and purple) in the container. 

The mole fraction for a gas is also equal to the partial pressure of the gas divided by the total pressure (Pt) (i.e., $$X_i=P_i/P_{tot}$$). The later relationship can be rearranged to show that the partial pressure of a gas is proportional to its mole fraction in a mixture ($$P_i=X_i*P_{tot}$$).
