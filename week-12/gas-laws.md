# Gas Laws


**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_

* Draw and recognize graphs plotting the relationships between P, V, T, and n.

* Use the ideal gas law to calculate P, V, T, n, or mass of a gas sample given the necessary experimental information.



A sample of gas is described by four state variables, pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T) and the amount of gas particles, usually expressed in moles (n). These variables completely define the state of a gas and dictate its physical experimentally measurable properties. We can explore the relationship between these variables by keeping two variables constant while manipulating the others. Under constant pressure and temperature, the volume of gas is directly proportional to the number of moles (Avogadro's law). At constant temperature and an unchanging number of moles of gas, the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume (Boyle's law). With the pressure and number of moles kept constant, the volume of gas is directly proportional to temperature (Charles's law). All of these PVT relationships can be derived directly from KMT.
