# Concentration of Ions

When ionic salts are dissolved in water, they completely dissociate because they are strong electrolytes.  Sometimes, chemists (and even biologists!) are interested in the concentration of a specific ion or total ion concentration. 

The stoichiometry (a ratio of quantities) in the dissolution process determines the concentration of ions in solution.  For example, let's consider when 1 mole of NaCl dissolves in 1 L of water. Since concentration is typically expressed in molarity (M or mol/L), then the concentration of NaCl would be 1 mole NaCl / 1 L = 1 M. NaCl will completely dissociate into Na<lrn-math>^+</lrn-math>  and Cl<lrn-math>^-</lrn-math> .  Considering stoichiometry, for every one NaCl, you get one Na<lrn-math>^+</lrn-math>  cation and one Cl<lrn-math>^-</lrn-math>  anion.  In this simple example, the concentration of both Na<lrn-math>^+</lrn-math>  and Cl<lrn-math>^-</lrn-math>  are each 1 M as well.  
Now let's look at a salt such as <lrn-math>SrCl_2</lrn-math> .  If we dissolve 1 mole of <lrn-math>SrCl_2</lrn-math>  in 1 L of water, the concentration of <lrn-math>SrCl_2</lrn-math>  will again be 1 M.  However, when <lrn-math>SrCl_2</lrn-math>  dissociates, one <lrn-math>Sr^{2+}</lrn-math>  cation and two <lrn-math>Cl^-</lrn-math>  anions are produced.  Using this stoichiometry, one can calculate the <lrn-math>Cl^-</lrn-math>  concentration and total ion concentration by the following:
<lrn-math>[Cl^-] = \frac{1 mol SrCl_2}{1 L} \frac{2 mol Cl^-}{1 mol SrCl_2} = 2 \text{ M } Cl^-</lrn-math>     
<lrn-math>[\text{total ion}] = \frac{1 mol SrCl_2}{1 L} \frac{3 \text{mol ions}}{1 mol SrCl_2} = 3 \text{ M } Cl^-</lrn-math>
