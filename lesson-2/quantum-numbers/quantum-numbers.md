# Quantum Numbers

When the Schrodinger equation is solved, it yields many possible wave functions. The wave functions themselves are fairly complicated and we will not examine them in detail.  Instead, we will introduce graphical representations (or plots) of the orbitals that correspond to the wave functions.  Each orbital is specified by three quantum numbers that allow us to know the
