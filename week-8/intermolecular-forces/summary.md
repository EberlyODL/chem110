**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_
* Identify the types of IMFs present between any chemical species.
* Predict trends in IMF strength for sets of molecules based on size, shape, polarity, and ability to form hydrogen bonds. Also be able to predict trends in melting/boiling points. 


The effects of IMFs are additive, and the overall strength of the IMFs in a substance is the sum of all of the IMFs that are present. In other words, some substances can make more than one of the interactions that we covered. For example, all substances, even polar ones, exhibit dispersion forces.
