**eBook**
Chemistry faculty at University Park have written an e-book that we will use as the text for this course.  Beyond text, the e-book has sample problems within the margins of each page that contain a full solution.  You will also find interactive figures and short demo videos embedded throughout.  
The homework sets will also be hosted in the e-book.  You'll find links to the  homework within each "Week X" page here in ELMS. 

**Videos**
In this course, I have prepared two types of videos.  The first type of video is a lecture-style video and the second demonstrates problem solving.

* The lecture-style videos are recorded in Penn State's One Button Studio.  These 5-10 minute videos are intended to introduce concepts and terms.  During these videos, you should be active and take notes.  There may be points where you are asked to answer a question.  These questions are not graded and provide a more engaging experience.

* Solved-problem videos will walk you through a method for solving a particular problem.  You will likely be asked to try this problem for yourself before watching the video.  Give it your best shot - the stakes will never be lower!  There may be other paths to solving a particular problem, so feel free to let me know if you arrived at an answer by a different method.
