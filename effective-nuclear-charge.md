# Effective Nuclear Charge

WhileImagine a light bulb as a nucleus and a lampshade as a shell (i.e. n = 1).  If you place a shell over the nucleus, an electron on the outside of the shell will "feel less attraction from the nucleus just as an observer sees less light from the bulb due to the shade.  Effective nuclear charge is the idea that an electron will "feel" less of the nuclear charge if it is shielded by other electrons.
We will learn that Coulomb's Law, shielding, and penetration all play a role in energy level splitting in a multi-electron atom.
