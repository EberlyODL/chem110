# Exam 3 Preparation

Exam 3 is coming in Week 11 and will be proctored through Examity. You will be able to schedule your 60-minute exam at your convenience between 03/29 at 12:00 am and 03/31 at 11:59 pm (EDT). The content covered on the exam will be weeks 8-10 (Chapters 10, 11, 13, 14.1-14.2, and 14.4 in the ebook).

The exam will be paper and pencil, so once you connect with a proctor you will download the exam file (periodic table and data sheet are included). You have the option to print all of the files. After 60 minutes, you will have additional time to scan/photograph your work and upload the file as a pdf/doc/docx file to Canvas. At that time, the proctor will walk you through deleting the exam file and scan/photo from your computer and/or phone.

## How to Schedule in Examity:

* Select “Schedule Exam” on the Dashboard

* Pick your instructor, course, and exam from the drop down menu.

* If you need to schedule less than 24 hours in advance, you will have to use the on-demand scheduling option; this option will cost $3.00.

## Resources:
I recommend reviewing homework problems, recitation worksheets, and problem sets before you dive into any practice exams. Use those when you feel you are ready to truly test yourself!
