<p>My name is Hannah Cole from Pittsburgh, PA! I am a Biology major, and I am currently deciding between PA school and Optometry school! If I could give one piece of advice to all of you, it would definitely be to stay on top of the material by reading over your notes and doing practice problems! Never be afraid to seek out our help through review sessions and office hours! Also, practice exams are your best friend! They are suuuuper helpful! I love answering questions, so feel free to reach out to me!!</p>

<p><span>Hi my name is Ashleigh Donato and I am from Woolwich Township, New Jersey (25 minutes from Philadelphia). I am a BBH major in hopes of eventually going to PA school.  I dream of working in the NICU at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. CHEM 110 is not as hard as everyone says as long as you study. What worked for me was doing the problem sets, homework problems, the practice exams, and going to office hours!!</span> </p>

<p>This is Hyoung Kim from South Korea and I am majoring in Engineering as a freshman and want to declare chemical engineering later.  I am interested in a job within a synthesis department in a chemical company in the United States as a future career.  During last semester in CHEM 110, I found working every problem set and studying with classmates in the library really helpful. Discussing with my friends helped me to find which parts I was uncertain about.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Lydia. I am from Shenyang, China. My major is Biology and I also minor in Chemistry. I would like to be a pharmacist in the future. For CHEM 110, I suppose the most important thing is to complete all the homework on time and figure out all the questions you have. Also, office hours are really helpful!  I wish you all have a great semester!</p>

For my future job, I imagine working with people who use  logical and critical thinking. CHEM 110 is a little difficult, but very interesting. I overcame this challenge by attending GSG study sessions and doing practice problems.</span><span> </span></p>

<h4><strong>Pooja Nerkar (<a href="mailto:pvn5107@psu.edu">pvn5107@psu.edu</a>)</strong></h4>
<p>My hometown is San Jose, CA and I am currently working towards a psychology major (neuroscience) and I am going to be a sophomore this year. My current goal is to go to med school after completing my undergraduate studies and then eventually becoming a psychiatrist. The best tip I have for CHEM 110 students is to keep up with the reading material by covering 1-2 sections a day, and following up with a few practice problems to get a handle on the concepts. This helps alleviate stress in studying for exams as well because you would have already studied the material in advance rather than cramming at the last minute.</p>

<p>I am going to major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and am thinking about minor in a foreign language. I was born and grew up in the Virginia and Washington D.C. area. After college, I am hoping to become a doctor or medical researcher. One habit that kept me afloat in CHEM 110 was reviewing not only the practice exams but the problem sets! </p>

<h4><strong>Chet Schwoyer (<a href="mailto:cas758@psu.edu">cas758@psu.edu</a></strong><strong>)</strong></h4>
<p>Chet is in his junior year in the Energy Business and Finance program. He transferred from Pennsylvania College of Technology located in Williamsport, PA, where he is from. After graduation he plans to be employed by an environmentally conscious energy company. His tip for success in CHEM 110 is to communicate your understanding of the clicker questions to your class mates, if they do not understand. Also, he recommends asking lots of questions about anything you are not 110% sure about, there will always be someone that is more then willing to help you out, but they have to know that you need it first.</p>

<p>Hi! My name is <span id="DWT780" class="ZmSearchResult"><span id="DWT791" class="ZmSearchResult">Hannah</span></span>, and I'm from Downingtown, PA (about 40 minutes outside of Philadelphia). I'm studying Biobehavioral Health, with hopes of becoming a Physician Assistant in the future. One tip that I have for CHEM 110 is to utilize the Knowledge Checks as a resource for extra practice - I found that these were sometimes more challenging questions, but they also made sure that I fully understood the material, rather than just memorizing information. </p>
