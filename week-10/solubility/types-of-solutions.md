# Types of Solutions

When solids are mixed in a liquid solvent, three types of solutions are possible depending on how much solute is added. Recall that the solubility of a solute is defined as the maximum amount that can be dissolved in a solvent. Solubility of most compounds increases with increasing temperature.  An _unsaturated_ solution results when there is less than the maximum amount of solute dissolved. This type of solution will appear homogenous.  A _saturated_ solution results when there is more solute than is soluble in the solution.  This solution will be heterogenous; solid in excess of the solubility will remain undissolved on the bottom of the container. A _super saturated_ solution must be prepared from a saturated solution by heating it so that all of the solute dissolves and then cooling carefully so that no precipitate forms.
