# Solubility

In this section, we will explore the properties of solids and liquids that make them soluble in one another.  The general mantra "like dissolves like" holds true where, generally, polar solutes are soluble in polar solvents and nonpolar solutes are soluble in nonpolar solvents.

Feel free to skip the few paragraphs in section 14.4 on the solubility of gases for now because we will return to this concept after we cover gases.
