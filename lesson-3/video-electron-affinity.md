# Electron Affinity

Electron affinity, in general, becomes more negative as we move left to right across the periodic table (makes sense since <lrn-math>Z_{eff}</lrn-math>  is increasing!).  Several exceptions occur in this trend as well due to especially stable electron configurations having filled subshells or shells.  The group 2 and group 8 elements have positive electron affinities since adding electrons to a new subshell (group 2) or shell  (group 8) will be unfavorable. There is no clear trend down a group.
