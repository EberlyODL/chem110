# Excited States

Atoms can be excited when they absorb energy.  The absorption of energy causes one or more electrons within the atom to "jump" to a higher energy orbital.  This will change the electron configuration.  There are essentially an infinite number of possible excited states for an atom or ion.  
Excited state electron configurations will still abide by the Pauli exclusion principle where no more than two electrons having opposite spins can occupy an orbital.
These higher energy configurations will, however, violate either the aufbau principle or Hund's rule.
