# Orbital Filling

There are a series of rules that are followed when placing electrons into orbitals to give the ground state (most stable) electron configuration of an atom.

There are a few exceptions to the order of filling in the transition metals.  I ask that you know two: chromium and copper.  The reason that these are an exception is due the extra stability when a subshell is half-filled or filled.  Since the energies of orbitals become closer together at higher _n_ shells, it becomes more common to see irregularities to the filling pattern.  Learn more in the video below.
