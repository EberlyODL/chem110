### Scientific Notation

Scientific notation is a way of expressing _really_ big or _really_ small numbers in a more convenient manner.  

Scientific notation takes the form of N x 10n.  N is a number between 1 and 10 and n is an integer value.  The exponent, n, will be negative if the number we are expressing is less than 1 and positive if it is greater than 1.

For example, one might write the number $$0.00000516$$ as $$5.16\times10^{-6}$$. 

How do we do this?

When we look at whole numbers, the decimal point is implied at the end of a number.

i.e. $$3,400,000,000,000.$$

We need to move that decimal point to the left until we get a number between 1 and 10.  We need to move the decimal point 12 times, so we would write the number like this:

$$3.4\times10^{12}$$

For numbers less than 1, we will move the decimal place to the right until we have a number between 1 and 10.

$$0.00000000890$$ becomes $$8.90\times10^{-9}$$ because we moved the decimal point 9 times.

We should also be able to go from scientific notation back to the "full" number.  The number $$2.45\times10^{-5}$$ can be written as $$0.0000245$$ by moving the decimal point in 5 spaces to the left (we know the negative exponent indicates a number less than 1).

 

### Significant Figures

Significant figures, otherwise known as sig figs, are the meaningful digits in a measurement or calculation.  The number of significant figures in a number is determined by how the number was measured or calculated.  Ultimately, the number of sig figs in your measurement or calculated result is indicative of the precision.  

**Significant Figure Rules**
All nonzero digits are significant.
Interior zeroes (zeroes between two nonzero digits) are always significant.
Leading/trailing zeroes: Imagine placing the number of interest inside a map of the United States as shown below.

(a) If a decimal point is present in the number (e.g. 0.00320), begin drawing an arrow from the side of the US with the Pacific Ocean, striking through all zeroes until you reach a nonzero number. The remaining numbers (no matter if they are zero or nonzero) are always significant.

(b) If a decimal point is absent in the number (e.g. 3200), begin drawing an arrow from the side of the US with the Atlantic Ocean, striking through all zeroes until you reach a nonzero number. The remaining numbers are significant.
