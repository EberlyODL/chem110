# Phase Diagrams


Phase diagrams are a graph of pressure plotted against temperature.  Phase diagrams can give a few useful pieces of information.

1) Phase(s) present under specific conditions (temperature and pressure)
2) Normal boiling and melting points (when pressure is 1 atm)
3) The boiling or melting points at any pressure
4) Predict changes that may occur with changing temperature and/or pressure
