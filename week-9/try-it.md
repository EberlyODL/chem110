### Problem 2

Liquid $$N_2$$ is poured over a bowl containing 5.0 g of grapes initially at 20 ºC, freezing them completely and cooling to -196 ºC.  How much energy is transferred from the grapes.  Assume that grapes are 100% water.

### Problem 3
Liquid $$N_2$$ is poured over a bowl of grapes freezing them completely. If you take 5.00 g of grapes and put them in your mouth, how much heat do they absorb as it goes from -196 ºC to 37 ºC? Assume that grapes are 100% water.
