### Problem 2
Liquid $$N_2$$ is poured over a bowl of marshmallows and they reach a temperature of -196 ºC. If you put one marshmallow (weighing 0.500 g) in your mouth, how much heat does it absorb as it goes from -196 °C to 37 °C, the temperature of your body? [The specific heat of marshmallows is 2 J/g·°C.]

### Problem 3

Liquid $$N_2$$ is poured over a bowl containing 5.0 g of grapes initially at 20 ºC, freezing them completely and cooling to -196 ºC.  How much energy is transferred from the grapes.  Assume that grapes are 100% water.

### Problem 3
If you take 5.00 g of the frozen grapes and put them in your mouth, how much heat do they absorb as it goes from -196 ºC to 37 ºC? Assume that grapes are 100% water.
