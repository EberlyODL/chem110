# Vapor Pressure

Vapor pressure, like boiling point and $$\Delta H_{vap}$$, depends on the strength of intermolecular forces (IMF) present between particles.  Vapor pressure defined as the pressure exerted by a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid or solid phase in a sealed container at a given temperature.  Essentially, some liquid (or solid) molecules at the surface will have enough energy to "escape" to the gas phase.  This gas exerts a pressure known as the vapor pressure.  (Pressure is a force caused by molecular collisions and we will explore pressure more in Chapter 12.)
