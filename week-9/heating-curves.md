# Heating Curves

**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_


* Define specific heat and molar heat capacity. Know the proper units for these quantities and be able to convert between these quantities using molar mass. 

* Sketch a heating/cooling curve of a pure substance, showing how the temperature of a substance is affected by the addition/removal of heat. 

* Describe the heating curves in terms of changes in kinetic and potential energy.  

* Calculate the total amount of heat transferred when a substance changes temperature and/or undergoes a phase transition.

When heat is applied to a system, two changes can occur: 1) the temperature could increase or 2) a phase change could occur.  The amount of heat required to warm a substance 1 <lrn-math>^{\circ}</lrn-math> C or 1 K is known as the heat capacity.  Heat capacity is an extrinsic property, meaning that it depends on the amount.  The specific heat (or specific heat capacity), <lrn-math>C_s</lrn-math>  is the amount of heat required to warm 1 g of a substance 1 <lrn-math>^{\circ}</lrn-math> C or 1 K.  The molar heat capacity, <lrn-math>C_m</lrn-math>  is the amount of heat necessary to warm 1 mol of a substance 1 <lrn-math>^{\circ}</lrn-math> C or 1 K.

Heating curves are a graph showing the temperature of a substance plotted against the amount of energy it has absorbed.  Cooling curves, on the other hand, show the temperature versus the amount of energy lost.  On the plot, you should be able to easily find melting and boiling points as well as identify the state present at a given temperature.  To learn more about these plots, please view the video below:
