**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_

* Apply the electron pair repulsion model (VSEPR) and use Lewis structures to determine the electron domain geometries and molecular geometries of atoms in a molecule.

* Predict the effects of lone pairs and multiple bonds on bond angles.

* Analyze the shape and bond angles of each central atom in a large molecule. 


Lewis structures convey only the connectivity of atoms and placement of electrons.  Using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model, we will be able to predict a molecule's three-dimensional shape.  The shape is important for determining a molecule's polarity, which has a big impact on its physical properties.  A practical application of molecular shape is in drug design.  Drugs are often small molecules that have a specific target in the body.  In order to bind or react with the target, the shape of the molecule has to be just right. 

The particular shape or geometry about an atom is based on the number of groups, known as domains, around a given atom.
