**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_
* Apply the electron pair repulsion model (VSEPR) and use Lewis structures to determine the electron domain geometries and molecular geometries of atoms in a molecule.
* Predict the effects of lone pairs and multiple bonds on bond angles.
* Analyze the shape and bond angles of each central atom in a large molecule. 


Lewis structures convey only the connectivity of atoms and placement of electrons.  Using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model, we will be able to predict a molecule's three-dimensional shape.  The shape is important for
