# Percent Yield

To evaluate how good our reaction is, we can calculate a percent yield.  

$$\text{% yield}= \frac{actual}{theoretical}\times100 \%$$

Often reactions will not result in 100% yield for several reasons.  One might be that the reaction just isn't very favorable, another might be that other products are formed (which decreases the yield of the desired product), and some product may be lost during your work up (extraction, filtration, purification).
