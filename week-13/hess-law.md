## Hess's Law

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4141|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right]

There are three strategies for calculating heats of reaction. The first of these is Hess’s Law, which states that the overall ΔH for any process is equal to the sum of the individual enthalpy changes for each step in the process. Figure 1 shows two hypothetical processes, the conversion of A to B with enthalpy change $$\Delta H_1$$ and the conversion of B to C with enthalpy change $$\Delta H_2$$. If we know the values of $$\Delta H_1$$ and $$\Delta H_2$$ we can use Hess’s Law to calculate ΔH for the conversion of A to C. If we add the two processes together (as shown on the slide) we produce the reaction: $$A + B \longrightarrow B + C$$. Since B is on both sides of the reaction we can simplify this to $$A \longrightarrow C$$. Since this reaction is the sum of two other reactions, its overall enthalpy change (let’s call it $$\Delta H_3$$) equals the $$\Delta H_1$$ + $$\Delta H_2$$, the sum of the enthalpy changes for its component steps. 

Hess’s Law works because enthalpy is a state function and is thus not path dependent. In this example it doesn’t matter which path is taken when A is converted to C, the enthalpy change will always be the same, regardless of whether B is formed as an intermediate during the process.
