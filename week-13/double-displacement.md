# Double Displacement Reactions


Double displacement, or metathesis, reactions take place between solutes in aqueous solution and are characterized by an exchange of ions or atoms.  Typically, metals (or hydrogen) are swapped in a chemical reaction according to the scheme below:

> $$AX + BY \longrightarrow BX  + AY$$

A reaction will occur when there is a "driving force."  The driving forces we will consider in the next few pages are:

 * Formation of a precipitate 
 * Formation of a gas
 * Formation of a weak electrolyte or nonelectrolyte

In these cases, a product is removed from the reaction mixture, driving the reaction to completion.  When a species is removed from the mixture, it can no longer participate in the reaction and prevents the reaction from going backwards.
