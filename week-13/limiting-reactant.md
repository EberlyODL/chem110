# Limiting Reactant

The limiting reactant is the reactant that is completely consumed and determines the maximum amount of product that can be produced.  For example, say that an ice cream sandwich requires 2 cookies and 1/2 cup of ice cream.  You have 6 cookies and 3 cups of ice cream.  The cookies you have would yield 3 ice cream sandwiches while the ice cream could make 6 ice cream sandwiches.  Since the cookies limit how many you can make, they are the limiting reactant!
