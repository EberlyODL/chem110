# Atoms versus Molecules

**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_

* Explain the difference between an atom and a molecule
* Identify a chemical formula given a molecular representation


Most elements don't actually exist in nature as individual atoms.  Atoms readily combine (bond) to form molecules or networks.  Some molecules and networks are pure elements (i.e. <lrn-math>0_2</lrn-math> , <lrn-math>S_8</lrn-math> , graphite).  Other molecules contain mixtures of elements and these are known as compounds (i.e. <lrn-math>NaCl</lrn-math> , <lrn-math>H_2O</lrn-math> , <lrn-math>NH_3</lrn-math> , <lrn-math>C_6H_{12}O_6</lrn-math> ).  We will discuss the details of molecular and ionic compounds in later lessons.  For now, we are just going to introduce the various ways that compounds can be represented.
