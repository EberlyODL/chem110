# Atoms versus Molecules

**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_

* Explain the difference between an atom and a molecule
* Identify a chemical formula given a molecular representation


Most elements don't actually exist in nature as individual atoms.  Atoms readily combine (bond) to form molecules or networks.  Some molecules and networks are pure elements (i.e. $$0_2$$, $$S_8$$, graphite).  Other molecules contain mixtures of elements and these are known as compounds (i.e. $$NaCl$$, $$H_2O$$, $$NH_3$$, $$C_6H_{12}O_6$$).  We will discuss the details of molecular and ionic compounds in later lessons.  For now, we are just going to introduce the various ways that compounds can be represented.
