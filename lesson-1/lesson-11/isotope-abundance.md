Learning Objectives: After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦

* calculate average atomic weights from isotopic weights and natural abundances
* solve for isotope mass or abundance given average atomic weight


An atom's identity is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus.  As an example, let's look at carbon (C).  Carbon has an atomic number of 6 and will have 6 protons.  However, not all carbon atoms are identical.  The number of neutrons in the nucleus can vary; carbon typically has 6 or 7 neutrons. Atoms that have the same number of protons, but a different number of neutrons are known as isotopes. The number of isotopes and their abundances for a given element varies.   Like the proton, a neutron has mass, so the mass of each isotope will be different.  The average atomic mass that you see on the periodic table is calculated by using the abundances and individual isotope masses.
