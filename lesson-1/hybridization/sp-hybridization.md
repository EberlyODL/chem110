# $$sp$$ Hybridization

$$sp$$ hybridization results from the mixing of a 2s orbital and a 2p orbital.  Since two orbitals are mixed, you end up with two $$sp$$ hybrid orbitals. There will be two atomic p orbitals that remains unhybridized.  These p orbitals will be empty or involved in pi bonds. Most atoms with two domains will be $$sp$$ hybridized.
