# $$sp^2$$ Hybridization

$$sp^2$$ hybridization results from the mixing of a 2s orbital and two 2p orbitals.  Since three orbitals are mixed, you end up with three $$sp^2$$ hybrid orbitals. There will be an atomic p orbital that remains unhybridized.  This p orbital will be empty or involved in a pi bond. Most atoms with three domains will be $$sp^2$$ hybridized.
