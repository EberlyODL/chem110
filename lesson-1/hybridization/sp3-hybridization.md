# Molecular Polarity

**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_
* Determine the hybrid orbitals involved in covalent bonding using Lewis structures, VSEPR shapes, and with consideration for resonance.
* Differentiate between sigma and pi bonds, and recognize the types of orbitals involved in these bonds.
