# Hybridization

Hybridization is the idea that atomic orbitals (s and p) mix to form hybrid orbitals.  This theory _explains_ some of the experimental measurements of bond lengths and angles in molecules.

The number of domains about an atom determines the type of orbitals used in forming sigma bonds or holding lone pairs.

## $$sp^3$$ Hybridization

$$sp^3$$ hybridization results from the mixing of a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals.  Since four orbitals are mixed, you end up with four $$sp^3$$ hybrid orbitals.  Most atoms with four domains will be $$sp^3$$ hybridized.
