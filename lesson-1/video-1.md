# The Mole


**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able to…_

* convert between molecular and macroscopic amounts of matter and energy using Avogadro’s number and the mole concept

The mole is the chemist's dozen.  We will use it to "count" atoms, molecules, photons, etc.  Often this is done by weighing a sample since the particles are so small to physically count them.  For now, we will focus on applying Avogadro's number ($$N_A$$) to covert between objects (atoms, molecules, photons, etc.) and moles. 

> 1 mole = <lrn-math>6.022\times10^{23}</lrn-math> objects 

Hopefully, that looks like something you have seen before.  It's the same concept as a dozen.
> 1 dozen = 12 objects
