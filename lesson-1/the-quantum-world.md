# The Quantum World

Bohr's model of the atom worked well for hydrogen.  Now, here's the bad news.  Wait for it...

It ONLY worked to explain the line spectra for the hydrogen atom.  Scientists went back to the drawing board.  Some 14 years later, quantum theory was born.

The central tenant of quantum theory is the wave nature of the electron.  Louis de Borglie first proposed that electrons behaved as waves in 1924, and it was later confirmed by experiments in 1927.  It was crazy at the time since electrons were thought of as particles and known to have mass.  Much like light, the wave nature of the electron is most apparent in its diffraction.  An interference pattern, similar to that observed for light, is seen when a beam of electrons passes through slits.  Further experiments revealed some very strange results.  I'll let Dr. Quantum explain.
When an unobserved electron passes through two slits, it behaves as a particle AND a wave simultaneously.  Schrodiner's cat is a thought experiment tch
