# The Quantum World

Bohr's model of the atom worked well for hydrogen.  Now, here's the bad news.  Wait for it...

It ONLY worked to explain the line spectra for the hydrogen atom.  Scientists went back to the drawing board.  Some 14 years later, quantum theory was born.

The central tenant of quantum theory is the wave nature of the electron.  Louis de Borglie first proposed that electrons behaved as waves in 1924, and it was later confirmed by experiments in 1927.
