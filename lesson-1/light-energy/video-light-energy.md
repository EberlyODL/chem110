# Characteristics of Light

**Learning Objectives:** _After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦_

* Define wavelength, frequency, and photon energy, and explore the relationship between wavelength and frequency, between energy and wavelength, and between energy and frequency.
* Recognize the ranges of wavelength of different regions in the electromagnetic spectrum and rank the relative order of wavelength (frequency, photon energy) of different regions in electromagnetic spectrum.
* Rank the relative order of colors and range of wavelength in the visible spectrum.
