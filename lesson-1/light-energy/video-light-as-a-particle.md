# Light as a Particle

There are three phenomena that are inconsistent with the wave nature of light:
* Blackbody radiation
* Photoelectric effect
* Line spectra

Blackbody radiation is the electromagnetic radiation emitted from a black body.  At sufficiently high temperatures, this radiation is in the form of visible light.  You've probably observed this when you heat the element on your stovetop.  The sun and hot lava are other examples of blackbodies.

Classical physics would predict that as the temperature of a blackbody increases, the energy would be emitted as more intense (brighter) light.  However, in reality, a shift to shorter (more blue) wavelengths occurs and a maximum intensity is reached.  

The classical model doesn't explain the experimental data! This led Planck to propose that energy of light was instead proportional to frequency (rather than intensity).
