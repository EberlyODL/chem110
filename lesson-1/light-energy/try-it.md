# Try it!

Give these problems a try.  A full solution is given in the video at the bottom of the page.  

A laser emits green light with a wavelength of 523 nm:

1. What is the energy of one photon from this laser? 

2. What is the energy of 1 mole of these photons?

3. If the laser emits 1.30 x 10$$^{-2}$$ J of energy during a pulse, how many photons are emitted during the pulse?
