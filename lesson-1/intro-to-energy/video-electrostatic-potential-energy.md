Learning Objectives: After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦

* Define electrostatic potential energy and apply Coulomb's Law to rank the overall electrostatic energy, and the strength of attraction for different interacting charges.

Electrostatic potential energy is the potential (stored) energy associated with the position of charged particles.
