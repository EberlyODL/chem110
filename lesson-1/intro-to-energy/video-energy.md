Learning Objectives: After this lesson, you should be able toâ€¦

* explain how internal energy is stored in materials as both kinetic energy (and its relation to temperature) and (electrostatic) potential energy, and how these quantities may interconvert
* explain the 1st law of thermodynamics and the energy flow between a system and its surroundings in the form of heat and work


Now that we know the basics, let's go a little deeper. We're starting on a quest to find exactly where those electrons are within an atom. Sure, they are in the electron cloud, but _where_? Electrons are responsible for all of the chemistry of the elements.  After all, electrons can be gained and lost easily (relative to the proton and neutron) and are involved in forming chemical bonds!

Before we get too far in our journey, we need to understand energy. In this lesson, we will look at energy in the forms of heat and work and how energy is transferred between a system and surroundings.
