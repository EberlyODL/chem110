# Week 4

It's exam week!  We have a lighter content load this week as you prepare for your test.  The content covered will NOT be on your first exam.  The first exam covers Weeks 1-3 (Chapters 1-4 in the ebook).  The exam and practice exam need to be scheduled more than 24 hours in advance to avoid a $3.00 on-demand fee.



## Action Items
* Schedule your exam in [Examity](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/1866869/external_tools/196889?display=borderless)
* Schedule and take practice exam 1B in Examity (optional, but encouraged!)
* [HW 3](https://genchem.science.psu.edu/homework-3-houck), is due Tuesday
* [Extra credit worksheet](https://media.ed.science.psu.edu/sites/media/ed/files/documents/pre_exam_1_extra_credit_worksheet_wc.pdf) due by Friday to Canvas
