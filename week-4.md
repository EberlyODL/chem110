Chemists and physicists were able to probe matter with light energy. The simple planetary model Bohr proposed was refined based on how light was emitted from excited atoms. We now are familiar with orbitals as regions of space that can be occupied by electron density, and that those dang electrons have some curious behavior. Like light, they exhibit wave-like properties (i.e. diffraction) and particle-like properties. A set of three quantum numbers provide an address of sorts to identify the most probable location and energy of an electron.
This week, we will finally know the true structure of an atom! The structure of an atom is its electron configuration. Many properties of the elements can be explained by examining their structure. The electron configuration will be a powerful tool in predicting the bonding and reactivity of various elements.
In fact, the periodic table was arranged by grouping elements with similar properties. As we will see, the arrangement of elements in the table is related to its electron configuration and produces several trends.
