# Week 4

It's exam week!  We have a lighter content load this week as you prepare for your test.  The content covered will NOT be on your first exam.  The first exam covers Weeks 1-3 (Chapters 1-4 in the ebook).  The exam and practice exam need to be scheduled more than 24 hours in advance to avoid a $3.00 on-demand fee.
