# Covalent Bonding

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3377|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=mediavideo__thumbnailright]

Covalent bonding results from the sharing of electrons between multiple nuclei. Molecular compounds (i.e., compounds that feature only covalent bonding) consist of individual molecules. Molecular compounds are essentially always composed only of nonmetals (or nonmetals and metalloids, which come from the right side of the periodic table as well). Hydrogen chloride (HCl), water, acetic acid (CH$$_3$$COOH, the acid found in vinegar), and ammonia (NH$$_3$$) are all molecular compounds, and they all consist exclusively of nonmetals. In contrast to ionic compounds, molecular compounds tend to have lower melting points. 

In contrast to ionic bonds  that tend to form when one atom gives one or more electrons to another atom, covalent bonding occurs when neither atom is “willing” to completely give up its electrons. Instead, the two atoms, red and blue in the diagram above, share the electrons, allowing both atoms to have access to eight electrons (completing their valence shell, or octet). (Note: Hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell.  When bonded to another atom, hydrogen has a "duet" of electrons.) Electrons are shared equally or unequally, depending on the atom (we will examine this later).
